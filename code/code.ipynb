    "    - Word count is probably the easiest metric to make a judgement on privacy policies on, but again, shorter doesn't mean better. The policy, while long, could also still be easy to understand. \n",
    "    - Average word length can be affected by words like articles and prepositions that are short, but not that meaningful on their own. \n",
    "    - TTR is largely dependent on the length of the policy. A higher TTR *could* mean lexical diversity, or it could just mean the policy is really short. \n",
    "- I did not get too many conclusive results out of this, and it's okay. This was less of a paper and more of an experiment with a hypothesis. My hypothesis that these metrics would be incredibly telling of the readability of privacy policies wasn't entirely correct, and that's fine. \n",
    "- Determining whether a policy is human-readable or not is a hard thing for a computer to do, so it's no surprise that I wasn't given all the answers. This idea is similar to the idea that I based this project off of:\n",
    "    - In my Data Science for Linguists (LING1340) class, we used these same metrics to determine the proficiency of L2 English speakers. This was a hard task for a computer to do, mostly for the same reasons as I stated above.\n",
    "    - I could only look at so many of these policies in full; printing out the entire policy would create blobs of text that would be daunting to read, which is exactly what I'm trying to tell these policy writers to avoid! \n",
    "- If I say a website's privacy policy is a good one, I am speaking on my data metrics. A good policy according to these metrics doesn't mean a good policy in practice. I'm well aware that Google has questional privacy practices, but *based on my metrics*, its privacy policy is at least human-readable. \n",

    "## Advice for Policy Writers\n",
    "- A shorter policy does not always mean a better policy! You can notify the reader whether or not your site uses cookies, but without an explanation of cookies, this doesn't inform them of much of anything\n",
    "- Despite each of the metrics I used not being of that much use by themselves on their own, word count is probably still what turns people off from reading the privacy policies. \n",
    "    - A reader will be overwhelmed if they have to read anything more than the equivalent of a few pages, double spaced. Keep it less than 8 pages, double spaced, which is equivalent to around 2000 words. Anything more and people will feel either overwhelmed by the amount of content or get bored halfway through and start skimming. \n",
    "- The fact that there aren't any legal-specific terms in your privacy policy doesn't necessarily mean they're easier to understand. There are quite a few words that I saw that an eighth grader still wouldn't get. This lack of understanding means a lack of informed consent. \n",
    "- Be *especially* careful when writing your policies that involve transactions. This is one of those cases where it's okay to be a bit lengthier.\n",
    "- Have outsiders proofread the policy just to make sure it makes sense. This sort of review is important because something that makes sense to a policy writer may not make the same amount of sense who isn't a policy writer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Advice for Internet Users\n",
    "- These policies can be overwhelming, and it isn't necessarily the fault of the user that some of them are too daunting to take on, but there are some steps you can take to navigate the longer policies:\n",
    "    - Use CTRL+F to look for privacy-related keywords, like \"personal identifiable information\", \"cookies\", \"collection\", etc. If a policy is full of fluff, it'll be easier to find what you really need to know if you look for certain keywords. \n",
    "    - Be informed! Look up the definitions of words like the above (\"cookies\", for example) if you don't know what they mean. Your understanding of them is essential to giving your true informed consent. If the policy doesn't define these things for you (which they should, if they're longer), then look them up.\n",
    "- Again, a shorter policy doesn't mean a better policy. If a privacy policy is lacking, fill in the gaps.\n",
    "    - See above with \"be informed\"! If a policy lacks certain definitions, look them up. \n",
    "    - If there isn't a list of what the website classifies as personal identifiable information, find a way to get into contact with the website to find out what exactly the site will be collecting. \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Final Statements\n",
    "This was a fun experiment to do. I don't have too many tools to expand on this further at the moment, but as I spend more time at Pitt and grow more proficient with text analysis, I may expand on this project to produce better results! I also tried to keep the writing that I did in my markdown cells within the range of a 6-8 page-ish paper, so I knew I'd be doing an equivalent amount of work to my peers who wrote papers. \n",
