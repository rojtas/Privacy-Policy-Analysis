    "The most common lengths for privacy policies seem to be 3000-3499, 1000-1499, and 0-499 words. According to [wordcounter.io](https://wordcounter.io/faq/how-many-pages-is-1500-words/), 3000-3499 words is like a 12-14 page paper, double spaced. 1000-1499 words is 4-6 pages, double spaced. 500 words is 2 pages, double spaced. It is promising to see quite a few policies below 1000 words. A shorter privacy policy means that people are probably more inclined to read it.  \n",

    "This is a pretty solid and easy-to-read policy. It gives the reader a way to opt out of email information being collected, and it specifies that the data Tanger Outlets collects from its customers is not sold or redistributed in any way. However, short privacy policies like this one may not be sufficient, as it doesn't describe what is defined as \"personal identifiable information\" (or PII). Lengthier policies are more likely to describe what constitutes this information. They're also more likely to elaborate on what the website uses this PII for. \n",

    "While I did anticipate that a shorter policy in terms of word count would be easy to read, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good policy. A human readable policy should be on the lower end of word count, yes, but too short of a word count can mean that important information and definitions regarding PII could potentially be omitted. This has the potential to leave the reader as clueless for a tiny policy as they would be for a huge, novel-length policy. In short, a lower word count tends to be better, but a website must be careful to not make the policy too short. This way, readers won't be overwhelmed by the amount of information, but they'll still be informed. "

This doesn't go for every single word in the English language, so this method of analysis by itself should be taken with a grain of salt. However, when combined with other metrics, it can be telling. Let's get started by creating a function that will get the average word length for each of the policies. "

       "'Privacy and Security Commitment Our Promise to You Dallas County Community College District\\'s (DCCCD) Privacy Commitment is based on two principles. We promise to Comply with all the applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations; and Protect your privacy while still offering relevant, personalized service. DCCCD is a public higher education institution and therefore bound by the Texas Public Information Act and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Continue reading for more detailed information about DCCCD\\'s Privacy and Security Commitment. Texas Public Information Act The Texas Public Information Act requires disclosure of information by a public body -- unless the law specifically protects the information. Most information kept by a public body is public under the Act. The State Attorney General enforces this Act. Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) FERPA protects educational records of a student from public disclosure without written permission of the student. Although many exceptions to the Act exist, the exceptions are very limited. The Department of Education enforces this Act. Directory Information Unless you request that your information be withheld, to comply with FERPA, DCCCD may release information classified as \"directory information\" to the general public without the written consent of the student. Directory information includes name; home address; home telephone number; email addresses; field of study; photograph; dates of attendance; enrollment status, i.e., full-time, part-time, undergraduate, graduate; degrees, certificates and other honors and awards received; the type of award received, i.e., academic, technical, tech-prep, or continuing education; participation in officially recognized activities; weight and height of members of athletic teams; student classification; name of the most recent previous institution attended How to request that your directory information be withheld A student may request that the institution withhold from the public all or any part of the student\\'s directory information. To request withholding of this information, a student shall give written notice (in person, by mail or fax) to the Registrar\\'s Office during the first 12 class days of a Fall or Spring semester or the first four class days of a Summer session. If they are unable to provide written notice within these time frames, credit students may protect their directory information at any time during the academic year through eConnect\\'s \\'My Privacy\\' feature. If a request to withhold information is not made, the institution shall release all directory information. Directory information is released only upon written request unless permitted by law. Telephone requests are not acceptable. Transcripts or academic records are not released without a student\\'s written consent except as allowed by law. Information collected by DCCCD DCCCD\\'s Web servers only record the visitor\\'s Internet Protocol (IP) address.

    "This is a pretty spot-on privacy policy. There's little legalese and while it is daunting to look at in one big blob of text like this, it's very probable that with appropriate headings and spaces, it's easy to read. It's under 1000 words, it reports on what services it uses with PII (Google Analytics, etc.), it references specific laws, and is very clear under what circumstances PII is released. This goes to show that average word length isn't really that good of a metric to measure whether a privacy policy is readable or not. However, as I mentioned before, it can be combined with other metrics to make a more informed argument.  \n",

We assume that minors 13 years of age or older have received permission from their parents or guardians before using this website.

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone browser from a websites computer and is stored on your devices hard drive. A website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browsers preferences allow it, but your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. During the course of any visit to the Sci-News.com website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. A website does this because cookies enable a publisher to find out whether the device has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit. Please note that during or after your visits to the Sci-News.com website you may notice some cookies that are not related to it. Sci-News.com does not control the dissemination of these cookies.

    "This is another great policy. It clearly states what it defines as PII, and even defines a cookie to those who might not be as Internet-literate. This definition and explanation of cookies is especially important to ensure that people know what they're signing up for. It even specifies that PII will be removed upon request if a user wishes to do so and instructs readers on how to do it.\n",

    "While DCCCD's policy is a bit longer, there is more PII that a community college may collect on its students. School websites have the justification to do this, so it makes sense that more regulations are outlined in DCCCD. Both privacy policies that I've looked at do all of the things a privacy policy should: keep it short and human-readable, but still outline the policy in a thorough way so users won't be left guessing over how much of their information is collected by the website. This thoroughness is what the Tanger Outlets policy lacks. It tells us about how PII is not shared with third parties, but does not specify anything about what PII exactly it collects. \n",

    "To conclude this section, though: average word length should *not* be the only metric used in determining whether a privacy policy is readable to the average Internet user. Both the policies with the longest and shortest average word length were perfectly readable and accomplished everything a privacy policy should. This doesn't mean this section was completely useless, however. As I've mentioned before, this metric can be a supplement for other metrics. That said, let's move on. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Type-Token Ratio\n",
    "The final metric that I'll be looking at is type-token ratio (TTR). TTR is a measure of lexical density, or word uniqueness. It takes the number of unique words and divides that number by the number of total words in a given string. A high TTR in this case could be an indication of lots of legalese being used. I will begin here by defining a function, much like the functions I've defined above, that gets the TTR for all of these policies. "
