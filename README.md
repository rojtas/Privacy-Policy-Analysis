# Privacy Policy Analysis
Lindsey Rojtas | ler75@pitt.edu | University of Pittsburgh Class of 2023 

## Summary 
This repository will act as my platform for my final project for Advanced Special Topics in Computing and Info (CMPINF 1999) at the University of Pittsburgh. The special topics we are covering are comparative digital privacies.  
  
Informed consent is difficult to acquire through an online platform. Privacy policies are a commonplace digital version of informed consent forms, but a user cannot be informed if they don't read the policy. Whether or not this is the fault of the user or the writer of the policy is up to the language used in the policy. I will be tokenizing privacy policies from a variety of different websites and analyzing the language used in these policies to determine whether the policies are short and simple enough for the average Internet user to be able to read. 

## About My Data
From [Usable Privacy Policy Project's website](https://usableprivacy.org/data):

*"The OPP-115 Corpus (Online Privacy Policies, set of 115) is a collection of website privacy policies (i.e., in natural language) with annotations that specify data practices in the text. Each privacy policy was read and annotated by three graduate students in law.*

*The dataset is made available for research, teaching, and scholarship purposes only, with further parameters in the spirit of a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License. Contact Prof. Norman Sadeh with any questions.*

*If you use this dataset as part of a publication, you must cite the following paper:*
